# interdependent-diffusion
This repository contains code for the simulations in `Interdependent Diffusion: The social contagion of interacting beliefs`


- `example_code.py` is readability-optimized code that contains everything needed to generate figures
- `model.py` is speed optimized
- `Demo.ipynb` shows how to run the demo code to produce simulation output
- `cluster_run_sims.py` sets up to run lots and lots of simulations in parallel.
- `Fig_2-3.ipynb` takes saved runs and makes figures 2 and 3
- `data/` contains simulation outputs used in generating figs 2 and 3
